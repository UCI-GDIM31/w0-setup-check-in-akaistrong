# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
    
    Hello, my name is Akai Strong (He/Him) and I'm a 19 year old 3rd year GDIM Major. I've always felt creativity inspired from the movies and games that I've been surrounded myself around
    since I was a young kid. I want to be able to build games that give people the spark to create their own visions in life. It doesn't have to be games specifically but I think it's important
    for people to express themselves creatively to inspire others to become better people. This class is one of the building blocks to being able to do that in a gaming media.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
    The base knowledge to start getting into creating games.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

    I might find it hard to code as I haven't had the best experiences beforehand.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

    Python

2. Game development (any engine)

    N/A

3. Unity

    N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document

    An overall way of telling people the way in which a game you want to create will be carried out

2. Scope management

    A way to keep your game from getting "too" ambitious, so cutting stuff out or realizing you don't have enough of a budget.
